# Cambridge University Academic Promotions Template

## Use at your own risk!

I am not maintaining this year-by-year, so don't rely on it being up-to-date once promotions are allowed again.

The [Makefile](Makefile) drives everything. In short,

* fill out your own [CV](cv.tex), [Statement](statement.tex), and [Research](annex-a.tex), [Teaching](annex-b.tex), and [Service](annex-c.tex) annexes; templates provided, I've tried to indicate variables to be replaced by NAMING them in all caps
* fill out the two coversheets: either the MS Word originals (in which case export to PDF) or the PDF copies I've included
* rename the assemblage templates [NAME-document-1.tex](NAME-document-1.tex) and [NAME-document-2.tex](NAME-document-2.tex) appropriately
* `make`, and see what happens...
